            <h2 class="about-heading">We Are...</h2>
                <p>a Tex Mex/American style taco shop and bar located in a small borough called Bellevue, right on the rim of the Pittsburgh city area. With Bellevue being a tight-knit community this is the perfect place to grab lunch, dinner, a drink, to watch your favoite sports teams or even host a party. Being partnered with other local businesses on a few of our menu items lets you know that we're not only here to feed the community but to be a strong part of it.</p>
            <h2 class="about-heading">Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to be that fun & tasty place that continues to be a driving staple for Bellevue. What we
                want to do is bring people together in a way that everyone loves - eating (tacos of course), drinking,
                hanging out and occasionally doing some karoke! We want to prove that in a foodie city like Pittsburgh,
                small businesses can make the most difference.</p>

                        <p>202 never disappoints me! Their food is truly amazing. The buffalo chicken tacos I just had were
                        so flavorful and juicy! As a matter of fact, ALL of the food here is exceptionally flavorful and
                        fresh. My order was up in less than 5 minutes, the watermelon margarita (to go) was sweet and
                        tasty and the staff is super friendly. This is of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood

                        was very busy and buzzing with good vibes. The selections were all tempting ðŸ¤¯ and delicious! I
